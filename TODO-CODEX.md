# TODO-CODEX.md - Active Execution Index

Last updated: 2026-07-24

This is the short current queue. Read `AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.md`, and this
file first. Use `DEVELOPMENT_TODO.md` for detailed history and decision records;
use `TODO.md` only as stale legacy reference after code verification. Current
mutable state is authoritative only in `PROJECT_STATE.md`.

## Current Active Work

### Coach Assignment Status Communication + Save Feedback

Status: **SOURCE FIX + LOCAL TEST AND COMMIT + PUSH GATES COMPLETE; FUNCTIONAL /
DOCUMENTATION SOURCE COMMITTED AND PUSHED; UNDEPLOYED; PRODUCTION UNTOUCHED**.

- `/coach/assign-groups` now separates red `unassigned/empty`, amber `changed`,
  and green `saved` without overlapping counts; `ต้องดำเนินการ` includes red plus
  amber.
- HTTP success shows success toast and immediate saved UI through a per-slot
  signature bound to the pre-Save Server baseline; a later draft edit or newer
  mismatching Server state invalidates the saved display.
- Local gates passed: deterministic `38/38`, Local E2E `6/6` residue `0`, focused
  Save E2E `1/1` residue `0`, Lesson Wallet `17/17`, TypeScript, ESLint, mojibake
  `247`, build `91/91`, and post-build clean local restart/static-asset smoke.
- Functional commit `fc9f228fa5fc165a3b961636267c6d8614f852cf` is pushed
  normal non-force with the exact approved three-file scope. The first push failed
  with GitHub request `EA08:392386:5E8D4:65A84:6A638F2A`; the single
  Owner-approved retry succeeded. The separate documentation closeout commit is
  also pushed normal non-force.
- Authoritative mutable state and full matrix: `PROJECT_STATE.md` → **Current
  Project Matrix — Coach Assignment Status Communication + Save Feedback**.
- Next Action: **Owner review before Deploy**. Do not deploy, access Production,
  open a PR, or start another task automatically.

## Recently Completed

### Coach Assignment Mixed-Level Save Regression

Status: **DONE — AUTHORITATIVE-NAME SOURCE COMMITTED/PUSHED/DEPLOYED/PROMOTED;
PRODUCTION-ACTIVE; LOCAL AND STAGED GATES PASSED; PRIOR EXACT REPAIR PASSED;
OWNER POST-PROMOTION LIVE SAVE AND READ-ONLY PRODUCTION RECONCILIATION PASSED**.

- Owner's post-promotion Production Save on exact เทพารักษ์ slot
  `6e27b409-27e8-4b67-966b-75b27248c13d`, 2026-07-25 09:00–11:00, is accepted
  business UAT evidence. `กลุ่มโค้ชชาติ` / Coach ชาติ / 5 learners / LV `3–11`
  and `กลุ่มโค้ชเบล` / Head Coach เบล / 4 learners / LV `7–35` persisted exactly.
  Mixed-Level remained warning-only and the UI settled to `มอบหมายแล้ว`.
- Vercel request `d2wlk-1784886263183-64f29b35ccf7` was the exact
  `POST /api/coach/assignment-groups` `200`; activity row
  `468e0e9f-7032-480a-8e17-43c779ae50de` records `2` groups / `9` students.
  Groups/members/legacy/reservations reconcile `2/9/2/2`, active verified
  learners are `9/9` exactly once, and all orphan/duplicate/identity/range/legacy/
  reservation mismatch counts are `0`. Notification delta was `0`.
- The observed 16:00–18:00 count change `5 → 4` was independent: learner session
  `cf4c224a-fe4c-4a5b-a24d-bd6a7b3f72fd` was rescheduled at
  `2026-07-24T09:18:32Z`, with activity `26ca576d-a53f-45be-8096-b919af161ce6`,
  about 26 minutes before the 09:44 Assignment Save. The successful Save's
  `router.refresh()` exposed that already-current count; Assignment Source/RPC
  has no booking/session/payment/wallet/attendance/payroll write path.

- Owner superseded the automatic Coach Save naming rule after Controlled Write
  UAT: every cleaned non-empty name visible at Save is authoritative; only outer
  whitespace and trailing `(N คน)` may be removed. Empty names must fail before a
  write. Mixed/incomplete Level remains warning-only and actual members own the
  saved Level range.
- Root cause: the deployed Coach-only resolver still interpreted `กลุ่ม N` and
  other placeholders from Level during draft initialization and Save. Owner
  reports staged Save changed `กลุ่ม 1`/`กลุ่ม 2` to Level-derived names.
- Coach-only forward fix commit `a3a573975bb0b8874baf2557aa3fcf9f0786229a`
  and its documentation closeout are committed and pushed. Shared/default naming
  and Admin Makeup remain unchanged; existing Coach client/API call sites consume
  the corrected resolver without requiring their own diff.
- Fresh Commit + Push gate Local evidence passed: deterministic assignment/isolation `32/32`, Local
  Supabase browser/API E2E `6/6` with residue `0`, conflict DB `21/21` with residue
  `0`, Admin Schedules performance `24/24`, Lesson Wallet `17/17`, TypeScript,
  ESLint with zero warnings, mojibake `247`, secret-addition scan, and diff check.
  The prior unchanged-worktree Production build `91/91` was not rerun; its
  post-build `.next` cleanup/clean restart remains not claimed.
- Exact HEAD `b6d974cdc8bee7966ca5d18e012bf069f1fe0e67`, tree
  `271908ac3f84be95391819fb01a47ac197460489`, is deployed as Production-target
  artifact `dpl_9Hb6invegeJEFo7o8Tt7EJ95Y6t9`, now `READY` / `PROMOTED`, Current,
  and Production-active through all four established aliases. Pinned Vercel CLI
  `56.5.0` promoted the existing exact artifact once with exit `0`; no deployment,
  rebuild, force, retry, rollback, or separate alias command occurred.
- Exactly four Production aliases moved from
  `dpl_h51j7Kk6E5FJ1ox3bVLRAL61gv4H` to `dpl_9Hb6invegeJEFo7o8Tt7EJ95Y6t9`;
  missing/extra aliases were `0/0` and branch-preview aliases were unchanged. No
  application route, Production API/database, environment, feature, allowlist,
  migration, or business-data write was exercised. Existing staged deployment
  `dpl_vsnYY1QWBybnR3rF51DsqamnQLg7` contains superseded behavior, remains
  unaliased/unpromoted, and must not be promoted.
- Owner-approved Chrome read-only staged UAT passed on the exact new artifact.
  Existing Head Coach authentication/authorization, page/data load, exact 24 July
  17:00–19:00 Thepharak slot, 2 groups / 7 learners, current persisted names,
  Coach/member mapping, desktop `1920x855`, and mobile `390x844` rendering passed.
  Console, page, hydration, Next.js overlay, 4xx/5xx, Vercel warning/error, and
  application mutation counts were `0`; all 50 unique Vercel requests were `GET`.
  That gate did not exercise Save; the later controlled gate below supplies the
  write proof.
- Read-only Production reconciliation found exact slot
  `8e2ede37-f7d3-4733-b63a-bd8504503f6f`, เทพารักษ์, 2026-07-24 17:00–19:00.
  Current groups/members/legacy/reservations reconcile `2/7/2/2` with all orphan,
  duplicate, range, identity, legacy, and reservation mismatches `0`.
- Owner-approved combined Controlled Write + exact repair then used the staged
  artifact once. The only mutation was request
  `xdlkj-1784881343649-b67b7bea8a1e`, `POST /api/coach/assignment-groups`, `200`.
  New group `bc51314c-7708-4ecb-bf56-98f3813fbdd5` persists `กลุ่ม 1` with the
  original Coach/four sessions/range `38–57`; new group
  `17df9379-0b77-49b2-a6ae-3d79569323e6` persists `กลุ่ม 2` with the original
  Coach/three sessions/range `9–22`.
- Post-write groups/members/legacy/reservations remained `2/7/2/2`; old group IDs
  were absent; all orphan/duplicate/range/identity/legacy/reservation mismatches
  were `0`. Exactly one activity row was added, notification delta was `0`, and
  booking/payment/wallet/attendance/check-in/teaching/payroll fingerprints were
  unchanged. No retry or restoration Save occurred.
- Data Repaired: **Yes — exact approved slot/two names only**. Production Data
  Changed: **Yes — atomic assignment-row replacement by the one approved Save**.
  Financial Impact: **None detected**. Production data changed by the Promotion
  gate: **0**. The authoritative-name Source is Production-active by control-plane
  evidence.
- The earlier read-only checkpoint's four deployment-wide booking availability/
  preview POSTs remain historical attribution evidence only. They did not match
  the Coach burst, and Source confirms both endpoints are SELECT-only; Owner
  accepted the later live Save as the closing business UAT evidence.
- Production UAT: **Passed — Owner post-promotion live Save**. Authoritative Save
  behavior and Controlled Write UAT: **Passed**. Data Repaired: **Yes — prior
  exact two-name repair only; this Save was normal Owner use**. Production Data
  Changed: **Yes — expected Owner Assignment Save; `0` from the read-only audit
  and documentation gate**. Financial Impact: **None detected**. Blocker:
  **None**. Task Done: **Yes**.
- Historical closeout next action: **Await Owner selection; do not start another
  task automatically.** This was superseded by the Active Work above.
- Historical release detail: `PROJECT_STATE.md` → **Historical / Superseded
  Project Matrix — Coach Assignment Mixed-Level Save Regression**.

### Admin Schedules Performance Phase B

Status: **DONE — PERMANENT `icn1` PRODUCTION-ACTIVE; READ-ONLY PRODUCTION UAT
PASSED WITH OWNER-ACCEPTED LIMITATIONS**.

- Permanent configuration commit `77db099607dd7ee8dfe265929a6720818e2015d1`
  is included in Production deployment `dpl_h51j7Kk6E5FJ1ox3bVLRAL61gv4H`, which
  is `READY` in `icn1`; all four established Production aliases map to it.
- Deployment-protection-aware smoke, Super Admin, Standard Admin, and verified
  mobile `390x844` read-only Production UAT passed. UAT business mutations and
  relevant application 5xx/runtime errors were `0`; rollback was not required.
- Owner accepted unavailable page-internal timing and unrun live forced
  error/retry. Prior Local error/loading/empty/stale evidence passed; live retry
  interaction remains unknown/not explicitly proven.
- Task Done: **Yes — Phase B**. Detailed final report:
  `docs/performance/admin-schedules-phase-b-final-production-closeout-2026-07-23.md`.

### Admin Schedules — Coach Overlap Guard and Ungrouped Coach Semantics

Status: **DONE — CORRECTIVE FORWARD SOURCE PRODUCTION-ACTIVE; READ-ONLY AND
CONTROLLED WRITE UAT PASSED; WRITE CONTAINMENT REMOVED; ALL 3 CONFIRMED DAMAGED
SLOTS REPAIRED AND OWNER-CONFIRMED**.

- Shared exact-overlap validation, legacy-only warnings, ungrouped display
  semantics, Level-source auto-name, dynamic member counts, atomic normal save,
  standalone read-only preflight, existing-group reservation backfill, lifecycle
  synchronization, and the concurrent-write migration are implemented and
  verified.
- Source/Test/Migration commit
  `1b995396f432d11b133c1cf4b5604b6db875b63b` remains pushed but is not
  Production-active after the confirmed Head Coach assignment and mixed-Level
  grouping regression and rollback. Emergency containment commit
  `3ad8a52dbda95b645608bce2f05917824e9763a6` was built from restored Source
  `0226e363f6677b078430f93459c2ee2ede6484e8`, pushed non-force on its scoped
  branch, and was deployed as Ready deployment `dpl_HTeRJnDLS5Z5ayEPGUvT2E4RGxti`.
  It is now the verified rollback target; all four Production aliases have since
  moved to the corrective Forward deployment recorded below. The Owner-authorized
  Nice/Ratchada repair is
  complete: exact group update `1` and matching legacy delete `1`. Three later
  Production-user actions intentionally moved its learners into Coach Base group
  `2e7...`; Owner confirmed Coach Base now owns all five learners and they must not
  be moved back. Former group `924...` has no coach and zero members. All five
  current Coach Base learners resolve to `basic / ชุดพื้นฐาน`. A fresh exact
  preflight passed and one conditional Production update changed only group
  `2e7...` name from `ยังไม่จัดกลุ่ม` to `ชุดพื้นฐาน`; affected rows `1`.
  Coach, five members, target legacy row, former group, Ramintra/Nice, attendance,
  check-in, teaching-hours/payroll, and financial evidence reconciled unchanged.
  Authenticated read-only Admin Schedules UAT shows Coach Base, `ชุดพื้นฐาน`, and
  the dynamic five-member count without console/page/hydration errors. Fresh
  migration-apply checkpoint preflight reported active exact groups `966`, current/future
  candidates `235`, blocking conflicts `0`, and historical report-only conflicts
  `8`. At the migration-apply checkpoint, approved migration `20260717070225`
  applied exactly once; remote pending was empty, reservations reconciled
  `235/235`, and missing/stale/orphan/mismatch rows were `0`. Production business
  data fingerprints and Coach/member/legacy targets
  remained unchanged. Exact Source `1b995396f432d11b133c1cf4b5604b6db875b63b`
  remains pushed but is no longer Production-active. At the containment checkpoint,
  containment infrastructure passed: deployment Ready, aliases `4/4`, `/`, `/api/health`, and static asset all
  `200`. Migration `20260717070225` remains applied exactly once. Protected totals
  and fingerprints matched before/after the no-write check: groups `1022`, members
  `2426`, legacy `996`, reservations `230`.
  At that checkpoint, authenticated Head Coach rendering was available at `36/39` assigned, `3`
  unassigned, and `135` learners. One authorized containment check returned `503`
  with code `COACH_ASSIGNMENT_SAVE_TEMPORARILY_DISABLED`; successful assignment
  Save activity after activation remained `0`.
  Incident activity logs show `51` successful normal Save operations across `47`
  slots, six Head Coaches, and six branches. Current surviving incident-window
  rows are `55` exact groups, `97` members, `50` legacy assignments, and `50`
  derived reservations. These operational writes were not controlled UAT and were
  not repaired. The 47 slots are the broader incident-window Save population;
  confirmed damaged slots were `3` at that incident checkpoint. Exact repair evidence is still required for
  each remaining damaged slot; row IDs and evidence limitations are in `DEVELOPMENT_TODO.md`.
  Pre-existing dirty
  `AGENTS.md`, `src/lib/schedule-slot-utils.ts`, and `docs/performance/` remain
  excluded; permanent `AGENTS.md` rule work remains separate.
- Historical failed-name checkpoint: Forward candidate Source/Test commit
  `c70f5a4ab92e8c3d33beb036e494d85e6e9bc0f9` (tree
  `0fecabd92e2f2c65b7bd59227b8d6b743e6bd820`) is pushed non-force on
  `codex/coach-assignment-forward-fix-20260718`. It is based directly on
  `1b995396...`, passes the full Local gate recorded in `PROJECT_STATE.md`, and is
  deployed only as Ready unpromoted dark artifact
  `dpl_CeoUkkLs2pSvcuLBzzdVNXn3dygD`. Production aliases remain `4/4` on
  containment `dpl_HTeRJnDLS5Z5ayEPGUvT2E4RGxti`; assignment writes remain
  disabled. Read-only Canary assignment semantics, mobile layout, Attendance,
  Teaching Programs, Wallet, DB fingerprints, and runtime 5xx checks otherwise
  passed, but one client React hydration `#418` occurred during the first Head
  Coach `/admin/schedules` guard redirect. It did not reproduce on a fresh Canary
  run or containment baseline. The Owner-authorized bounded retest then completed
  `56/56` clean client cycles across Canary and containment: direct `/coach`, hard
  reload, role-guard redirect, mobile 390x844, and three fresh logins per
  environment all had React `#418`/hydration/console/page errors and redirect loops
  `0`. Canary assignment semantics re-passed read-only. However, containment
  emitted one distinct middleware `refresh_token_not_found` error on `GET /`
  during the logout/login cycles, with response `200`; Canary runtime
  error/fatal/5xx remained `0/0/0`. At that intermediate checkpoint the overall
  zero-runtime-error gate was not passed; Owner later accepted this distinct
  containment baseline as non-blocking. Protected assignment counts/fingerprints remained groups
  `1022`, members `2426`, legacy `996`, reservations `230`; reservation business
  fields reconciled `230/230` with mismatch `0`; successful assignment Saves after
  containment remained `0`. One reservation timestamp-only refresh was traced to
  normal coach check-in/attendance activity, not an assignment mutation. No
  Controlled Write, promotion, or damaged-slot repair occurred.
- Historical bounded-retest Owner decision: Owner classified the one Containment-only
  `AuthApiError: Invalid Refresh Token: Refresh Token Not Found` as
  **ACCEPTED NON-BLOCKING CONTAINMENT AUTH-SESSION BASELINE**. It did not occur on
  Forward Canary, did not fail login or HTTP, and is unrelated to the Coach
  Assignment diff. Preserve it as an unauthorized separate follow-up. Forward
  Canary read-only UAT is **Passed**; original React `#418` remains **Unknown /
  Non-reproducible after clean bounded retest**; aliases promoted **No**.
- Historical first Controlled Write checkpoint: Owner/Head Coach then confirmed and saved one exact dark-Canary payload for slot
  `53c3556a-6067-4ad1-813c-ca8410d17994` exactly once. The Save was atomic:
  groups/members/legacy/reservations changed from `0/0/0/0` to `2/5/2/2`, global
  totals are `1024/2431/998/232`, and no orphan, mismatch, conflict, partial
  deletion, console error, or attendance/check-in/program/payment/wallet change
  was found. Controlled Write UAT nevertheless **Failed** because submitted manual
  names `ระดับสูง` and `กลาง-สูง` were stored as `กลุ่มผสม` and `ชุดพื้นฐาน` on
  groups `c56af2cf...` and `ec77cf98...`. The Source treats those legacy labels as
  auto-generated before the RPC. At that checkpoint another Save and promotion
  were prohibited; the slot was not closed as repaired and damaged slots remained
  `3`. The corrective checkpoint below supersedes this historical gate.
- Corrective manual-name Source/Test commit
  `9ef1ee30035a083426743aed3e326ad9676d65c4`, tree
  `94fe2410f0361acf639c47a4be7245c01128f21d`, is pushed non-force from parent
  `c70f5a4...`. It preserves every trimmed non-placeholder manual name and
  auto-names only blank, exact `ยังไม่จัดกลุ่ม`, or generic `กลุ่ม N` input after
  removing a trailing `(N คน)` suffix. Local gates passed: assignment/naming/
  authorization `33/33`, DB conflict/concurrency/lifecycle `22/22`, Playwright
  desktop/mobile `3/3`, Lesson Wallet `17/17`, TypeScript, ESLint, mojibake, diff
  check, Production Build, clean restart, and residue `0`.
- Owner/Head Coach performed one corrective Save on slot
  `53c3556a-6067-4ad1-813c-ca8410d17994` through dark Canary
  `dpl_GSYEioBLHodQWLu2CRmbBQeWnhXX`. Controlled Write UAT passed: persisted names
  are `ระดับสูง` and `กลาง-สูง`; exact coach/member mapping remained `2/5`; legacy
  and reservation rows remained complete `2/2`; no partial write, orphan,
  mismatch, conflict, unsaved indicator, console/runtime/500/constraint error, or
  attendance/check-in/payroll/financial change was found. The 21 July Chaeng
  Watthana slot is repaired.
- The exact same Canary artifact was promoted without rebuild and is now Ready on
  all four Production aliases. Corrective Forward Source is Production-active;
  assignment writes are enabled and temporary containment is inactive. Public
  `/`, `/api/health`, static assets, authenticated Head Coach rendering, and
  post-promotion logs passed. Three later real Head Coach Saves succeeded without
  runtime/500/constraint errors. Current/future reservations reconcile `221/221`;
  missing/physical orphan/mismatch `0/0/0`. Fresh totals are groups `1026`, members
  `2436`, legacy `1000`, reservations `234`. Rollback target
  remains `dpl_HTeRJnDLS5Z5ayEPGUvT2E4RGxti`; migration remains applied once.
- The later activity includes the 22 and 29 July Suvarnabhumi slots. Each now has
  one `กลุ่มผสม`, three members, one exact coach, one legacy row, and one matching
  reservation. These rows are technically complete, but Codex did not receive the
  intended payloads before the real-user Saves, so correctness initially remained
  Unknown. Owner subsequently confirmed both actual payloads are correct. All
  three confirmed damaged slots are repaired and Task Done is **Yes**.
- Exact current matrix, Owner decisions, affected row ids, local test evidence,
  and controlled Production repair evidence are authoritative in `PROJECT_STATE.md` under
  **Admin Schedules — Coach Overlap Guard and Ungrouped Coach Semantics**.

Current next action is owned by the Active Work section above and the authoritative
matrix in `PROJECT_STATE.md`: **Owner review before a separate Deploy gate for
Coach Assignment Status Communication + Save Feedback. Do not deploy, run
Production UAT/write, open a PR, start the auth follow-up, historical cleanup,
permanent dirty `AGENTS.md` work, Homepage LV, or another Parking Lot task without
a new Owner gate.**

## Earlier Completed

  `039ad6e03ca0cb8c8c4334c81818c570b03b9287` was active in Ready deployment
  `dpl_6QCDg6omy3ZTFCm36W8G3AH7YqNr`. The feature remains included in the newer
  global Production Source; authoritative current deployment state is only in
  `PROJECT_STATE.md`.
- Authenticated read-only Production UAT passed default Bangkok today, date/time/
  same-time แจ้งวัฒนะ ordering, manual one-/two-sided date filters, search/status/
  coach/branch/course filters, pagination, detail selection, reload stability,
  console/hydration, and no-write/runtime gates.

### Production Lesson Wallet Canonical Recurring-Round Redemption

Status: **DONE — SOURCE DEPLOYED; NO-WRITE AND OWNER-VERIFIED CONTROLLED WRITE
PRODUCTION UAT PASSED**.

- At its 2026-07-15 closeout, Functional Source
  `bb7bd8b8015fb3fa7f0998b5bf8a1e5220e034ae` was active in Ready deployment
  `dpl_9ijGRLyvmMa9aT3EkP5zbqxkf6at` on all four aliases. Current Production
  deployment state is authoritative only in `PROJECT_STATE.md`.
- Read-only reconciliation distinguished exactly one successful redemption and a
  separate subsequent Owner Wallet-store action. Canonical target evidence is
  intact; active duplicate/overlap, orphan, Payment, coupon, Ledger, allocation,
  Finance, and repair counts attributable to the redemption are `0`.
- Authoritative current detail and the final consistency matrix are in
  `PROJECT_STATE.md`; dated evidence is in the 2026-07-15 Lesson Wallet record in
  `DEVELOPMENT_TODO.md`.

### Dashboard Booking Unlimited Slot Entry + Customer Price UX

NO-WRITE PRODUCTION UAT PASSED**.

- Authoritative current state is in `PROJECT_STATE.md` under **Dashboard Booking
  Unlimited Slot Entry + Customer Price UX** and **Production**. Detailed dated
  evidence is in the 2026-07-15 release closeout in `DEVELOPMENT_TODO.md`.

### History Payment Selection 409 / Invalid Slip Modal State

Status: **DONE**.

- Authoritative current state is in `PROJECT_STATE.md`; dated implementation and
  Production UAT evidence remains in `DEVELOPMENT_TODO.md`.

## Parking Lot

### Homepage LV Copy Audit/Fix

Status: **PARKING LOT — OWNER SELECTION REQUIRED; NOT AUTHORIZED TO START**.

- Audit homepage copy for `LV 71+` / `70+` language against the active school
  level contract of LV 0-70.
- Do not introduce LV 71+ as current Production behavior without explicit Owner
  confirmation.
- Await explicit Owner selection before any audit or implementation work.

## Historical / Superseded Reference — Kids Group Pricing Reconciliation

State observed at the 2026-07-13 closeout. This retained reference is historical;
current mutable state is authoritative only in `PROJECT_STATE.md`. Pricing
reconciliation closed at that checkpoint, and Unlimited Slot Entry later became a
separate task that is now also DONE:
**PASS — PROGRESSIVE SUMMARY FIXED; OPTION A ENTRY ACTIVE; PRODUCTION 4+4=2,000 UAT PASSED; PRICING RECONCILIATION DONE**.

Confirmed final state:

- Permanent Option A policy is unchanged: every new general Kids Group booking
  uses Progressive after Entry activation; eligible Legacy bookings contribute
  only `bookings.total_sessions` entitlement to the initial baseline; Legacy money
  is never deducted and Legacy rows are never repriced, scoped, snapshotted,
  credited, refunded, or backfilled.
- Progressive summary root cause was localized to
  `src/components/dashboard/booking-client.tsx`: the component stored too little
  preview evidence and rendered the Legacy monthly true-up explanation for every
  Kids Group summary.
- Source fix commit `aa64adfb765139ca38908ca2409fa2127ffe4a29`
  uses the authoritative server preview `mode`, preserves the full Progressive
  preview evidence, renders a Progressive-only booking-level explanation, and
  leaves Legacy, Adult Group, Private, coupon, and zero-price business semantics
  unchanged.
- Narrow regression coverage is in `scripts/check-progressive-booking-entry.js`.
  Booking-entry checks increased from `25` to `31` and cover Progressive `4+4`,
  coupon, zero Legacy baseline, exact Legacy `4+4`, Adult Group, and Private.
- Source verification passed: booking entry `31`, Option A baseline `32`,
  Progressive pricing `17`, transactions `33`, coupon `38`, Legacy
  pricing/payment `14`, TypeScript, lint, mojibake `225`, build `90` routes, and
  `git diff --check`.
- Source commit was pushed to
  `origin/spike/next-major-security-upgrade`.
- Corrected Entry-absent rollback deployment is
  `dpl_GyGnKWq49mTU6NYNavWRVYLwmo3P`, Ready from exact clean source
  `aa64adf` on all four aliases when verified. Entry-off authenticated Kids Group
  remained Legacy: previous `4` / `2,500`, new `4`, cumulative `8`, rate `500`,
  target `4,000`, deduction `2,500`, charge `1,500`; Progressive-only copy was
  absent.
- Final activation deployment is
  `dpl_CJVW2EMw9pfacn4NeAj4vqPsaSsS`, Ready from the same exact clean source
  `aa64adf` on all four aliases. Production Entry is the exact non-sensitive
  value `true`; allowlist remains absent; all four Progressive dependencies and
  shared `SLIPOK_TEST_MODE` remain unchanged.
- The final activation required a forced rebuild because unchanged source had
  initially reused the Entry-off build cache. The forced artifact is the
  authoritative final deployment above.
- Authenticated no-write July UAT passed: eligible Legacy `2+2=4`, historical
  amounts `1,250+1,250=2,500`, cancelled rows excluded, previous Progressive `0`,
  new `4`, cumulative `8`, rate `500`, coupon `0`, gross/final `2,000`.
- Customer Summary visibly shows `คำนวณราคา Progressive สำหรับการจองครั้งนี้`,
  baseline `4`, previous Progressive `0`, new `4`, cumulative `8`, rate `500`,
  `ราคาการจองใหม่: 4 × 500 = 2,000 บาท`, and the preservation statement that
  historical payment is not deducted. Legacy target/deduction/credit wording is
  absent.
- Adult Group and Private remain Legacy by the unchanged server-only entry
  decision and deterministic regression proof. Existing Progressive History,
  approved batch, and payment-drain capabilities remain readable/Ready.
- Unauthenticated booking preview is `401`. Activation logs sampled `28` requests:
  error `0`, 5xx `0`, baseline fault `0`, dependency fault `0`, SlipOK `0`,
  booking-create POST `0`, and successful preview `1`. Browser console warnings/
  errors and hydration errors were `0`.
- Protected pre/post counts and SHA-256 fingerprints matched at every checkpoint:
  bookings `519`, sessions `2,785`, scopes `2`, snapshots `519`, receipts `3`,
  coupon reservations/usages `0/0`, batches/members `4/4`, attempts/allocations
  `1/1`, payments `470`, Ledger `471`, wallet `60`, attendance `1,622`,
  notifications `16,147`, tiers `11`, Finance expenses `1`, existing Progressive
  bookings `2`, approved batches `1`, and the repaired booking. UAT-attributable
  business-data delta is `0`.
- No booking was confirmed. No Booking, Payment, scope, session, snapshot,
  receipt, coupon, wallet, attendance, notification, Ledger, Finance, refund,
  credit, pricing-tier, Legacy, Adult Group, or Private write occurred.
- Rollback was not required after the successful final artifact. At that historical
  closeout, the corrected Entry-absent deployment was the documented rollback
  target; it is not a rollback target for Unlimited Slot Entry.

| Committed | Yes - source commit; documentation closeout follows separately |
| Pushed | Yes - source commit; documentation closeout follows separately |
| Migration applied | Yes - `20260713210000` exactly once |
| Deployed | Yes - `dpl_CJVW2EMw9pfacn4NeAj4vqPsaSsS` Ready |
| Dependencies enabled | Yes - four dependency controls unchanged/true |
| Entry enabled | Yes - exact Production value `true` |
| Allowlisted | No - absent and not required |
| Production active | Yes - new general Kids Group uses Progressive |
| Production UAT | Passed - authoritative and visible `4+4=2,000` |
| Adult/Private | Legacy |
| Data repaired this round | No |

## Worktree / Safety Notes

- Branch: `spike/next-major-security-upgrade`.
- The pre-existing unrelated unstaged `AGENTS.md` and
  `src/lib/schedule-slot-utils.ts` changes remain excluded.
- Historical safety note: the Owner-controlled Production `4+4` draft was restored
  browser-locally after two atomic `409` capacity rejections. No booking was created.
  Do not replay Production confirmation without separate Owner authorization.
- Historical booking-regression rollback evidence referenced
  `dpl_CJVW2EMw9pfacn4NeAj4vqPsaSsS`. It is not a rollback target for Unlimited
  Slot Entry. At the pre-release checkpoint, its Source Fix was committed and
  pushed but its remote migration, deployment, and Production UAT had not yet
  occurred. That checkpoint is superseded by the completed release state in
  `PROJECT_STATE.md`.

## Session Exit Checklist

- Apply the Session Closeout Protocol in `AGENTS.md`.
- Update `PROJECT_STATE.md` and this file whenever policy, source, Production
  state, risks/blockers, or the next task changes.
- Put long reconciliation/release history in `DEVELOPMENT_TODO.md`.
- Run `npm.cmd run check:mojibake` and `git diff --check` for documentation edits.
- Next action: **Owner review before a separate Deploy gate for Coach Assignment
  Status Communication + Save Feedback. Do not deploy, perform Production
  UAT/write, promote, open a PR, start Homepage LV, the auth follow-up, historical
  cleanup, permanent dirty-file work, or another Parking Lot task automatically.**
